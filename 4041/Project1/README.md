Comparing Sorting Algorithms
============================

This is a program that runs and compares Heap Sort,
Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort on an input
file.

The file must be of the following form:

Number1
Number2

This program will output a file containing the sorted list
called {Input-file-name}.sorted, and it will out put a 
file called {Input-file-name}.stats that lists the 
number of seconds taken to sort.
